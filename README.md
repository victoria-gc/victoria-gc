  <p> I moved to Madrid in 2021 to start my journey as a programmer. During my time at            university I have learnt plenty of programming languages and worked on a wide range of
  projects. These experiences have helped me build a strong skill set and have given me the       confidence to take on any coding challenge I set my mind to.
